*Note: The Cloud PAL team will review submissions at the beginning of each quarter. If your proposal is selected, you will be notified and assigned a Cloud PAL Focal. Remember, Cloud PAL is a collaborative system. So while your Focal is there to guide you, teams are responsible for the creation and document of new contributions.*
