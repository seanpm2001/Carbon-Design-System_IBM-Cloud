> Cloud PAL will maintain an early adopters channel dedicated to accessing the latest code for the both Cloud PAL and Carbon v11 release. In this slack channel, teams can download and use the beta release and ask questions/get support. After joining the early adopters program, youâ€™ll be added to the channel.
