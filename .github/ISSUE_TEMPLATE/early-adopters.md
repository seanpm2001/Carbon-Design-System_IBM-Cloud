## 2. When is best to reach out you for a breif status update (every two weeks)?
> As the Cloud PAL team is working towards their next major update, we’ll be setting up regular checkpoints. This will possibly be an optional, biweekly (every other week) meeting or slack message.

> Cloud PAL will maintain an early adopters channel dedicated to accessing the latest code for the both Cloud PAL and Carbon v11 release. In this slack channel, teams can download and use the beta release and ask questions/get support. After joining the early adopters program, you’ll be added to the channel.
