## Description

Side panels display additional information for objects within a page. They help users gain context and make edits
while still viewing the contents of the page.

Side panels can display up to three levels of additional information, and may include form fields, code snippets
and static visualizations. They can also walk users through a multi-step flow, display teachable moments, and edit content in tables.

## Usage

Careful! The SidePanel content can not be rendered within a component defined within render as this is an [anti-pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#dont-use-hocs-inside-the-render-method) and can cause various issues.

1.  Install the [@console/pal](https://github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/pal#how-to-install-and-use) library
2.  Import the styles:

    ```js
    @import '@console/pal/Components/SidePanel/styles';
    ```

3.  Import the component:

    ```js
    import { SidePanel, SidePanelContainer } from "./";
    ```

4.  Render the component.

For general component usage review the [Components Docs](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/pal/development-guidelines/components/overview).

### Multi-step side panels

<p>
  Multi step side panels are handled by placing more than one SidePanel
  component in a SidePanelContainer. Navigation between panels is provided by
  the component.
</p>
<p>
  The first SidePanel will have a primary "next" button and a secondary "cancel"
  button.
</p>
<p>
  Subsequent SidePanels before the last will have a primary "next" button and a
  secondary "previous" button.
</p>
<p>
  The final SidePanel will have a primary "done" button and a secondary
  "previous" button.
</p>
<p>
  The text for all buttons can be overridden by providing the appropriate
  property. The properties can be set on the SidePanelContainer and will be
  inherited by any SidePanel that does not declare its own value for the
  property.
</p>
<p>
  If any sort of validation is needed before navigating to the next (or
  previous) SidePanel, you can assign a function to the appropriate click event
  passed into the component via props. That function will be called when the
  event is fired. To prevent navigation, the function should return false.
</p>

### Nested side panels

<p>
  A control within a side panel can be made to open a nested side panel. To open
  a nested SidePanel, set it's parent's <em>nestedPanel</em> component to be an
  array of nested panels. The nested SidePanel will open over the parent side
  panel, but the parent side panel will remain loaded in the DOM. The nested
  panel will have two navigation buttons. A 'previous' button will close the
  nested panel, uncovering the parent. A 'done' button will do the same, but
  event handlers are provided for both to allow for canceling and saving
  submissions. The text of these buttons can be overridden with the{" "}
  <em>previousText</em>
  and <em>DoneText</em> properties. The default closing behavior will be prevented
  if a function assigned to <em>onPreviousClick</em> or <em>onDoneClick</em> property
  returns false.
</p>
<p>
  A Panel which may potentially contain a nested panel should have its
  _breadCrumbText_ property set to a string that will be displayed as a
  breadcrumb at the top of the side panel. Each nested panel should also have
  its _breadCrumbText_ property set.
</p>
<p>Any given panel of a multi-step panel may contain a nested panel.</p>

## Focus

<p>
  A SidePanel with an overlay (<em>hasOverlay</em> set to true) will capture
  focus. By default the item focused will be the primaryButton rendered in the
  sidePanel. If you want a specific element to be focused by default, you can
  add a data attribute, <em>data-focus-first</em>, to the element you want to be
  focused when the SidePanel opens.
</p>

### Controlling Pagination

Pagination is controlled within the `SidePanelContainer` component and can be controlled using props passed to a SidePanel with a single React
component as a child. The following props are exposed for controlling pagination during

## Props for SidePanel

<ArgsTable of={SidePanel} />

## Props for SidePanelContainer

<ArgsTable of={SidePanelContainer} />

## Loading State

Since there is no predefined content for a side panel, there is no loading state provided.
