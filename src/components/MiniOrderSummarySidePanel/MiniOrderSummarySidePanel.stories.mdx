MiniOrderSummarySidePanel and MiniOrderSummary are components designed to be used in conjuction to allow users to both configure and create orders within the context of a side panel. The needed configuration for the order is typically simple. More complex configurations should use a Catalog provisioning page.
MiniOrderSummarySidePanel manages the form area of the side panel and provides transitions for the expanding / collapsing MiniOrderSummary. This component is meant to work exactly like SidePanel. For more information, see [Side panel](/components/side-panel/code) code documentation.
MiniOrderSummary manages the displayed order details. This component is meant to work similar to OrderSummaryV2. For more information, see [Order summary V2](/components/order-summary-v2/code) code documentation.
**NOTE:** It is required that every Order Summary includes the `estimateData` to pass along to the cost estimator.
