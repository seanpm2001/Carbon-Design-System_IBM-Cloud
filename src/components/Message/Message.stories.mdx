## Description

The empty state message component is a fallback component for communicating errors such as no data, fetching errors, unauthorized access, or no results to the user.
It is best used _after_ attempting to load content and should be used to inform the user as to whether there was an error, they do not have access, or there is no content available.
Also consider offering a way for the user try again in case of an error and / or explain what caused the error if possible.

### Error boundary component and fetching errors

Consider using the empty state Message component in combination with [ErrorBoundary](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/pal/components/error-boundary/code) component to catch errors and prevent JS code from crashing React.

## Usage

1.  Install the [@console/pal](https://github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/pal#how-to-install-and-use) library
2.  Import the styles:

    ```js
    @import 'carbon-for-ibm-cloud/components/Message/styles';
    ```

3.  Import the component:

    ```js
    import { Message } from "carbon-for-ibm-cloud/components";
    ```

4.  Render the component.

For general component usage review the [Components Docs](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/pal/development-guidelines/components/overview).
